# Where am I?

You're on a PvP game page. It is a console project that has originally been created to master Java classes and building an architecture of the application with classes in general.

To start playing, simply clone the repo and start the Main class.

# Short guide
Here in the game you and your opponent are able to choose from three types of units: Wizard, Knight and Terminator.
The fight goes consequentially. Player 1 makes first move, Player 2 makes a second one etc.
At the moment when one of players loses all the units (total 3), the game ends and information is being printed.
